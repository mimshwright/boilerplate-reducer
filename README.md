# Redux boilerplate-reducer

Quickly create bundles of action types, action creators, and reducers with a few lines of code.

## Motivation

> I created boilerplate-reducer to reduce reducer boilerplate

When using [redux](http://redux.js.org/), I found that I was writing a lot of code to create essentially the same types of objects. Even with great tools like [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions) and [reduce-reducers](https://github.com/acdlite/reduce-reducers), and the guidelines for [reducing boilerplate](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ReducingBoilerplate.html) and [combining reducer logic](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/ReusingReducerLogic.html), I found that I was still writing a lot of similar code with minor differences. So I created `boilerplate-reducer` to reduce reducer boilerplate.

_Note: This is a helper and should not be a replacement for understanding the core concepts of Redux (e.g. that reducers can respond to any action types, even those that might be associated with other parts of the state tree). If you're new to Redux, come back after you've written some boilerplate code and gotten fed up!_

### Goals
- Make it easier to write commonly used redux code with a few lines and a little faith
- Never force the user into following the assumptions made by the library
- Allow the user to extend and customize what is created and make functions granular enough to work in other contexts
- Functions have no side effects (that's the whole reason we like Redux, right?)
- Be compatible with things like thunks, sagas, flowtype, immutable.js, etc. (eventually)

## Implementation

`boilerplate-reducer` makes it easy to mash a lot of functions together into a bundle, but behind the scenes it makes use of several tried-and-tested tools for working with Redux. Action creators are generated with [createAction()](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions). Reducers are created with [handleAction()](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions#handleactiontype-reducer--reducermap--identity-defaultstate) and [reduceReducers()](https://github.com/acdlite/reduce-reducers). I recommend knowing a bit about what each one does. <strike>If</strike> When you need to extend the functionality of your app or run into issues, these tools will let you tweak things under the hood.

`boilerplate-reducer` is an opinionated library. It makes assumptions about how you want your results formatted and what types of actions and reducers are considered generic.

Results are returned as an object bundle that follows the [Ducks modular format](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) which means related action types, action creators, selectors, and reducers are defined in the same file. In my experience, ducks is a great system. However, if it's not your thing, you can still use some of the lower-level tools in this library (although you might not avoid as much boilerplate code).

### Verbs and Nouns

Actions are created by combining a "noun" and a "verb". In the case of `"ADD_TODO"`, the verb would be `"add"` and the noun would be `"todo"`. Some string manipulation is applied so `"Add 10 to", "totalScore"` would become the action type `"ADD_10_TO_TOTAL_SCORE"` and the action creator would be called `add10ToTotalScore()`.
